[h1][b]Stellar Expansion is NOT required.[/b][/h1]
It is simply compatible with this mod and designed to work alongside it.

This is a simple addon mod meant to provide small midgame boosts to FTL.

It remains separate from [b][i][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=718529178]Stellar Expansion[/url][/i][/b] because FTL is a cornerstone of the game and not everyone is necessarily interested in having it altered. Also, this ensures more gameplay compatibility with other FTL altering mods.

Having said that, these techs should work properly along any other FTL affecting mods or rebalances that you may have.

Some sort of improvement will be coming for Wormholes, once I can figure out a good balance for it.
