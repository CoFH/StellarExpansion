CoFH - Stellar Expansion - Voidcraft
Author: King Lemming

Whee! Voidcraft - it's really just the fancy Stellaris term for "spaceships" and
that's exactly what this mod adds.

Given the relative nightmare of ship balance, please see "Spaceships" for
overall design goals for the mod, but I won't be painstakingly explaining every
change down to the slot.

At the moment, AI do not make fantastic use of these ships, as they are not
standard classes. While that's a bit unfortunate for normal play, it does mean
that Awakened Fallen Empires and the endgame crises are a bit more manageable
when the 1.3 empire AI inevitably fails to do anything useful.

Heavy Ships
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heavy Ships exist to add a bit of a mineral sink and provide a bit more of a
combat advantage, given similarly sized fleets. Their Slot layouts are in some
cases less flexible than that of standard ships.

Conceptually, these are heavier gunboats. They excel at general purpose combat,
with the notable exception of the Heavy Cruiser's Siege Sections.

	Advantages
	----------------------------------------
	+40% Hull Points
	+10% Base Armor
	+5 Accuracy
	+5 Tracking
	+Weapon Range (varies with size)
	+Utility Slots (varies with size)

	Disadvantages
	----------------------------------------
	+25% Fleet Supply Used, Rounded [1]
	+25% Build Time
	+100% Base Cost
	No Large Weapons

	Other
	----------------------------------------
	Alternate Slot Layouts
	Alternate Roles

Support Ships
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Support Ships are essentially platforms for Auras. Auras have smaller ranges
compared to those present in 1.2, and the utility offered by each support ship
is slightly different.

Conceptually, these ships act as force multipliers and should not be considered
as the backbone of a fleet. They are far too expensive and do not possess
significant offensive combat abilities beyond that of standard ships.

	Advantages
	----------------------------------------
	+30% Hull Points
	+5% Base Armor
	+5 Evasion
	+Weapon Range (varies with size) [2]
	+Utility Slots (varies with size) [3]
	+Ability to use Auras (varies with size)

	Disadvantages
	----------------------------------------
	+100% Fleet Supply Used [4]
	+50% Build Time
	+200% Base Cost
	No Large Weapons

	Other
	----------------------------------------
	Alternate Slot Layouts
	Alternate Roles

# Notes
################################################################################

[1]	Heavy Corvettes get a free pass here since it rounds down, so they instead
	have a lower base Evasion score and are very slightly slower in combat.

[2]	Support Corvettes do not have increased range.

[3]	In some cases this may be an extra Hangar Slot instead of a Utility slot.

[4]	This basically means 2x Supply is necessary. A support ship costs the same
	as a ship one size class larger.
