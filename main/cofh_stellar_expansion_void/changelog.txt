2016-11-27:
Localization overhaul. Placeholder localization files for all languages.

Tweaked how Corvette models were being assigned, which should increase cross-mod compatibility.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2016-11-17:
Added support for Advanced Ship Behavior Modules and Ship Power Stations.

If you do not have one or both of these mods installed, you will see an error
in your startup log. However, this error is 100% harmless.

I heavily considered a compatibility patch for this, but decided against it as
any errors associated with integrated support are harmless.
