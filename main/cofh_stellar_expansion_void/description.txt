This is a rather large addition to [b][i][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=718529178]Stellar Expansion[/url][/i][/b] - new ship classes!

1.3 [Heinlein] saw a reimagining of Hull sections and a rebalancing of ship roles, as well as the removal of Ship-based Auras. 2.0 [Cherryh] changed things up even further, and changed how Auras work in general. Rather than add entirely new ship classes, this mod will add new Ship Sections. This allows for greater compatibility with other mods.
