CoFH - Stellar Expansion - FTL Enhanced
Author: King Lemming

Howdy! So here's the deal with this particular addon. Given that FTL is a very
foundational aspect of gameplay, I will be isolating any changes to it in this
submodule.

The technologies added by this mod can be acquired once an empire possesses a
form of FTL travel that incurs either a Windup (Hyperlane, Jump) or Winddown
(Warp, Jump) time. This means that Warp and Hyperlane can acquire their
technologies before researching Jump Drives, which makes their mid to late-game
play a bit more competitive with Wormhole.

In the future, I may add more FTL-related technologies and modules. The new Aux
Utility slot in particular has some potential.
