CoFH - Stellar Expansion - FTL Enhanced
Author: King Lemming

Okay, so basically the entire mod has been rewritten. Here's why:

The purpose of this mod was to boost mid-game for Warp and Hyperlane. When repeatable tech costs changed, these shifted to a point in the tech tree where they were only slightly in front of Jump Drive. They also ended up costing a ton of research for what they did. So, they're no longer repeatable, and they're tier 2 technologies now.

They are Rare, but don't worry - having better FTL tech will significantly increase your chances of drawing them.

New Technologies:
	Exigent Sensor Calibration:
		Voidcraft
		+25% Ship Sensor Range
		-25% Emergency FTL Jump Cooldown

	Structural Integrity Fields
		Field Manipulation
		+10% Ship Hull Points
		-25% Emergency FTL Damage

Changed Technologies:
	Hypernavigation Calibration:
		Particles
		-25% FTL Jump Charge Time

	Spacetime Resonance Damping
		Field Manipulation
		-25% FTL Jump Cooldown
