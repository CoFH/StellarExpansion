Updated for 2.0.0 [Cherryh].

This is basically a straight port, but with the 2.0 changes in place.

Outdated modifiers have been changed to fit with the new FTL mechanics.
Tech costs have been adjusted (stuff all seems way more expensive, there may be rebalancing).

Okay, so basically the entire mod has been rewritten. Here's why:

The purpose of this mod was to boost mid-game for Warp and Hyperlane. When repeatable tech costs changed, these shifted to a point in the tech tree where they were only slightly in front of Jump Drive. They also ended up costing a ton of research for what they did. So, they're no longer repeatable, and they're tier 2 technologies now.

They are Rare, but don't worry - having better FTL tech will significantly increase your chances of drawing them.

New Technologies:
	Exigent Sensor Calibration:
		Voidcraft
		+25% Ship Sensor Range
		-25% Emergency FTL Jump Cooldown

	Structural Integrity Fields
		Field Manipulation
		+10% Ship Hull Points
		-25% Emergency FTL Damage

Changed Technologies:
	Hypernavigation Calibration:
		Particles
		-25% FTL Jump Charge Time

	Spacetime Resonance Damping
		Field Manipulation
		-25% FTL Jump Cooldown
