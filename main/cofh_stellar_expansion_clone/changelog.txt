Clones can now be created of any biological species in your Empire. Enjoy. :)

You can even apply templates. Thanks "TheFirstPaige" for this!

Updated for 1.8.0 [Capek].

For the most part, this is a straight port.

Opinion penalties have been greatly reduced.

Synthetically Ascended Empires can still make use of "limited" Mass Cloning, for non-Synthetic species.

Added a new War Demand: Abolish Mass Cloning. Works just like the AI Ban except Fallen Empires will not currently offer a "task," although I will look into adding one in the future.

Mod now exists. :)

It's basically a single technology - Mass Cloning - and an associated Policy, which allow for a couple of avenues of drastically increasing biological population growth.

New Technologies:
	Mass Cloning:
		Biology
		Unlocks Building: Genomic Replication Facility
		Unlocks Buildable Pop: Clone Population

New Buildings:
	Genomic Replication Facility:
		Planet-Unique
		+4 Society Produced
		+15% Population Growth Speed
		*+50% Population Growth Speed with Limited or Unrestricted Mass Cloning

New Buildable Pops:
	Clone Population:
		Same as Primary Species
		+200% Population Growth Speed
		*-25% Research and -50% Unity produced for 5 years after completion
