Mod now exists. :)

It's basically a single technology - Mass Cloning - and an associated Policy, which allow for a couple of avenues of drastically increasing biological population growth.

New Technologies:
	Mass Cloning:
		Biology
		Unlocks Building: Genomic Replication Facility
		Unlocks Buildable Pop: Clone Population

New Buildings:
	Genomic Replication Facility:
		Planet-Unique
		+4 Society Produced
		+15% Population Growth Speed
		*+50% Population Growth Speed with Limited or Unrestricted Mass Cloning

New Buildable Pops:
	Clone Population:
		Same as Primary Species
		+200% Population Growth Speed
		*-25% Research and -50% Unity produced for 5 years after completion
