CoFH - Stellar Expansion - Geoengineering

Updated for 1.6 [Adams].

Okay, so the Ecological Adaptation tech introduced with the 1.6 update basically obsoleted most of this mod. So it's been repurposed.

I will be adding more to it, but to get *something* out relatively quickly, I'm releasing an update which contains 2 buildings and the Geoengineering tech.

Plans at the moment include adding modifiers to planets and Special Projects and Event Chains which will assist in terraformation.

Buildings:
	Geoengineering Institute:
		Empire-Unique
		+4 Physics Produced
		+4 Society Produced
		+4 Engineering Produced
		+5% Habitability on Planet

		+50% Terraforming Speed
		-15% Tile Blocker Clear Cost
		-15% Tile Blocker Clear Time

	Geoengineering Complex:
		Planet-Unique
		+2 Physics Produced
		+2 Society Produced
		+2 Engineering Produced
		+5% Habitability on Planet

Updated for 1.5 [Banks].

No actual changes - just version incrementing.

I will eventually work some Ascension Perks into this. :)

Updated for 1.4 [Kennedy].

No actual changes - just version incrementing.

2016-11-27:
Localization overhaul. Placeholder localization files for all languages.

2016-11-14:
Fixed an issue with some missing localization strings.

2016-11-08:
Major rework of the mod to handle incorrect behaviors. Apologies for the oversights.

-Special Projects are no longer part of an Event Chain.
-Terraformation Projects now require that you choose the specific planet type that you want in the popup window.
-Terraformation Projects have a 30 day timeout window, upon which you may select a different planet (if you misclicked).
-Geoclimatic event severity has been decreased, but they are more frequent and you can have multiples appear at once now.

-This update has inconsistent behavior with existing saves - projects which are in progress or available are going to look weird in the situation log. To fix this, open the console (` by default) and type:

"event cofh_se_geo.999" without the quotation marks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2016-11-06:
Added non-Tomb World restrictions to all terraformers except for the Climate Restoration Reactor.

Touched up localization slightly. Yay red text!

2016-11-05:
Mod now exists. :)

It's basically a single technology - Planetary Geoengineering - which allows for the construction of a Geoengineering Complex. The building provides some research on its own, but it notably can be upgraded with Terraformation Reactors which allow for an inhabited world to be terraformed.

New Technologies:
	Planetary Geoengineering:
		New Worlds
		Unlocks Building: Geoengineering Complex (and Upgrades)

New Buildings:
	Geoengineering Complex:
		Planet-Unique
		+2 Physics Produced
		+2 Society Produced
		+2 Engineering Produced

	Climate Moderation Complex:
		Planet-Unique
		+2 Physics Produced
		+2 Society Produced
		+2 Engineering Produced
		+10% Habitability on Planet

	Terrestrial Reformation Reactor:
		Planet-Unique
		+2 Physics Produced
		+2 Society Produced
		+2 Engineering Produced
		*Allows planet to be Terraformed

	Atmospheric Variation Reactor:
		Planet-Unique
		+2 Physics Produced
		+2 Society Produced
		+2 Engineering Produced
		*Allows planet to be Terraformed

	Climate Restoration Reactor:
		Planet-Unique
		+2 Physics Produced
		+2 Society Produced
		+2 Engineering Produced
		*Allows planet to be Terraformed
		**Requires Tomb World

	Gaiaformation Reactor:
		Planet-Unique
		+2 Physics Produced
		+2 Society Produced
		+2 Engineering Produced
		*Allows planet to be Terraformed
