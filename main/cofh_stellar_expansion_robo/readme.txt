CoFH - Stellar Expansion - FTL Enhanced
Author: King Lemming

Howdy! So here's the deal with this particular addon. Paradox seems to be in
the middle of a rebalance with FTL in this post-1.3 world, and given that FTL is
a very foundational aspect of gameplay, I have decided to move any changes out
of the main mod and into this submodule.

The technologies added by this mod can be acquired once an empire possesses a
form of FTL travel that incurs either a Windup (Hyperlane, Jump) or Winddown
(Warp, Jump) time. This means that Warp and Hyperlane can acquire their
technologies before researching Jump Drives, which makes their mid to late-game
play a bit more competitive with Wormhole.

In the future, I may add more FTL-related technologies and modules. The new Aux
Utility slot in particular has some potential.
