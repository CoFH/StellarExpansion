Added new Strategic Resource: Ixrybun Crystals. If you're currently in a game, it won't show up. You'll need a new one for that.

When SRs were overhauled in 1.3, Explosive and Kinetic Weapons received a relative boost in that there was a resource which provided +10% damage to those weapon types. Energy did not have such a resource. It now does.

And yes, it's a red crystal. A red stone if you will. Those of you familiar with my Minecraft work will get it.

Also, new buildings for the remaining resources, as well as Ixrybun. To keep the research "even" among these buildings, Neutronium now generates Engineering Research instead of Physics.

New Buildings:
	Dark Matter Concentrator:
		Empire-Unique
		+8 Physics Produced
		+10% Ship Combat Speed
		+10% Ship Speed
		+5 Ship Evasion

	Ixrybun Deposition Plant:
		Empire-Unique
		+8 Physics Produced
		+5% Research Speed

	Living Metal Depot:
		Empire-Unique
		+8 Society Produced
		-10% Ship Upkeep Cost
		+25% Ship Repair Speed

New Technologies:
	Ixrybun Crystal Mining:
		Industry
		Reveals Ixrybun Crystals

Changed Buildings:
	Neutronium Armory:
		Empire-Unique
		+8 Engineering Produced
		+25% Army Damage
		+25% Army Health

Removed files which weren't ready for deployment. Sorry about that!

Mod now exists. :)

For the moment, this is pretty simple - 9 buildings to make use of Strategic Resources. They aren't quite what the old ones used to be, but they provide slightly more incentive to acquire Strategic Resources.
