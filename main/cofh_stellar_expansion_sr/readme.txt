CoFH - Stellar Expansion - Strategic Resources
Author: King Lemming

Hello there! Some of you who played Stellaris and Stellar Expansion before the
1.3 [Heinlein] patch may remember that Strategic Resources worked in a very
different way.

One thing that Stellar Expansion used to do was add Strategic Resource buildings
for those resources which did not have them. Since Paradox decided to remove all
of those buildings from the base game, I have created new versions of them to
fit with the new Strategic Resource mechanics.

Unlike the old buildings, these buildings also generate a Strategic Resource, in
effect NOT consuming it. The buildings themselves are Empire-Unique, however. If
the original resource is made unavailable, the building will correctly stop
working.

NOTE: All buildings require their respective Strategic Resource to construct and
maintain, but also "produce" that resource, so it is not actually consumed.
