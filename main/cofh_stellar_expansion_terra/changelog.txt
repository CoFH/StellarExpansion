CoFH - Stellar Expansion - Terraforming

2016-12-06:
Atmosphere Creation is no longer marked as a "rare" technology.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2016-12-05:
Updated for 1.4 [Kennedy].

No actual changes - just version incrementing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2016-11-27:
Localization overhaul. Placeholder localization files for all languages.

Minor adjustment to tech progression and weighting - one is no longer a prerequisite for the other. Technologies show up slightly more often, and researching one makes it MUCH more likely that the other will show up as an option.

Changed terraforming costs of Barren and Cold Barren planets to match that of Toxic and Tomb worlds.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2016-11-02:
Complete rewrite for 1.3.x [Heinlein].

Terraforming costs are in line with the base game and will require terraforming resources or Capacitor Banks from Stellar Expansion in some cases.

Gaia World Terraforming has obviously been removed, as it's part of the base game now.

2016-07-28:
Internal refactoring and naming convention rework.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2016-07-13:
Just some internal refactoring. :)
Oh, and the Gaia World Terraforming icon is *slightly* more green.

Bugfix:
	Cold Barren planets can now actually be terraformed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, so here's the deal. Terraforming is a big, gamechanger of a technology, so the techs will be transitioning OUT of Stellar Expansion. This mod will play alongside it seamlessly.

And, you can safely have both of these installed - when the techs are removed from Stellar Expansion proper, nothing will change in your game.

As of this patch, here are the costs:

Atmospheric Purification:
	New Worlds
	Allows Tomb and Toxic Worlds to be terraformed into habitable ones.
	(15 Years, 2500 Energy, combined 6 Terraforming Liquid/Gas)

Habitable World Terraforming:
	New Worlds
	Allows Barren and Cold Barren worlds to be terraformed into habitable ones.
	(20 Years, 3000 Energy, 3 Terraforming Liquid/Gas)

Gaia World Terraforming:
	Rare, New Worlds
	Allows habitable worlds to be terraformed into Gaia worlds.
	(20 Years, 3000 Energy, 2 Terraforming Liquid/Gas, Engos Vapor, Pitharan Dust)
