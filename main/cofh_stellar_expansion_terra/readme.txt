CoFH - Stellar Expansion - Terraforming
Author: King Lemming

This mod is pretty straightforward - it expands the orbital terraforming options
that empires have. Specifically, it allows for Toxic, Barren, and Cold Barren
worlds to be terraformed.

However, these worlds can only be terraformed directly into a limited subset of
habitable types. They can of course be terraformed *again* if you desire.

Given that these planets are not normally inhabitable, there is a penalty in the
form of permanent negative modifiers which will always make them slightly less
than optimal compared to a "normal" planet.
