CoFH - Stellar Expansion - Terraforming (Extreme)
Author: King Lemming

This mod is also pretty straightforward - it's another terraforming mod and
expands the orbital terraforming options that empires have. Specifically, it
allows for Frozen and Molten worlds to be terraformed.

However, these worlds can only be terraformed directly into a limited subset of
habitable types. They can of course be terraformed *again* if you desire.

Given that these planets are not normally inhabitable, there is a penalty in the
form of permanent negative modifiers which will always make them slightly less
than optimal compared to a "normal" planet.
