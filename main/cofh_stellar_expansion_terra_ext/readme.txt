CoFH - Stellar Expansion - Terraforming (Extreme)
Author: King Lemming

This mod is also pretty straightforward - it's another terraforming mod and
expands the orbital terraforming options that empires have. Specifically, it
allows for Frozen and Molten worlds to be terraformed.

However, these worlds can only be terraformed directly into a limited subset of
habitable types. They can of course be terraformed *again* if you desire.

Note that these techs are on the same level as Gaia Creation, and will require
either access to both Terraforming Gas and Terraforming Liquid, or a number of
Capacitor Banks from Stellar Expansion.
