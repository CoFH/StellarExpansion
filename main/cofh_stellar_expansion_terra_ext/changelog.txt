CoFH - Stellar Expansion - Terraforming (Extreme)
Author: King Lemming

Complete rewrite for 1.3.x [Heinlein].

Terraforming costs are in line with the base game and will require terraforming resources or Capacitor Banks from Stellar Expansion in some cases.

There are now two separate techs as the necessary processes for each planet type would be *extremely* different.

An addonandon?

I had some requests to revert the terraforming changes and allow for Molten and Frozen planets to be terraformed.

No, I won't be doing that. But here's an addon to the addon that will allow you to do that if you choose.

It adds a single new Technology - Extreme Terraforming.
