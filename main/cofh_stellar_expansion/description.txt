For those of you familiar with my Minecraft mods, hope you get the reference.

This mod will contain my attempts to expand on the gameplay and content of Stellaris in whatever ways I deem interesting. I will attempt at all times to NOT modify or overwrite base game (vanilla) files. If I do, those files will be in a separate mod. Ultimately, I try to expand on the mechanics of the game while respecting the initial paradigm set forth by the developers.

So basically, this is not a full overhaul mod - it just adds a lot of stuff that integrates well into the look and feel of the base game.

[list]
	[*]Five (5) new buildings for various Ethos which complement their playstyle and expand options.
	[*]Capacitor Banks - buildings which add Energy Storage to the empire, in the same fashion as Mineral Silos.
	[*]Diplomatic Hub - a building which generates Influence and also increases Maximum Stored Influence.
	[*]Twelve (12) Non-repeatable and 10 Repeatable technologies to add more variety and depth to the midgame.
	[*]Three (3) Crisis Countermeasure technologies which activate during their respective endgame crises.

To keep things from becoming too overwhelming and/or unbalanced, potentially game-changing mods are split into addon modules. They may be used standalone unless indicated through Steam requirements.
